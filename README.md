# MTASA Auto-Trains

This is a resource for the [MTASA](https://mtasa.com/) multiplayer mod for GTA San Andreas.

It adds an autonomous shuttle train system, where the user can enter a marker at any train station, and a train will spawn and take them along.

It was initially intended to be a fully fledged autonomous train system, with trains circling the game map, stopping at stations, slowing down when necessary, and keeping safe distance between the trains, however, to continue running the trains MTA requires a player to be nearby, so it became a shuttle system.

## Features

* Enter a marker and a train will be spawned for the player.
* The train will then circle the map and stop at each station.
* The trains are removed when the player exits.
